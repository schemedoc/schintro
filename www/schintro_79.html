<H1><A NAME="SEC85" HREF="schintro_toc.html#SEC85">Using Scheme (A Tutorial)</A></H1>

<P>
In this chapter, I'll describe how Scheme works from the user's point
of view, and how to write simple programs in Scheme.  You should follow
along, experimenting with the actual Scheme system you use. 

</P>
<P>
This chapter is not meant to be read independently of the previous chapter.
I've included notes saying which parts of the previous chapter you should
read before working through parts of this one.  If you haven't already,
you should read the first part of that chapter.

</P>
<P>
This chapter is also not meant to be read without a running Scheme
system to try things out.
