<H3><A NAME="SEC42" HREF="schintro_toc.html#SEC42">Some Handy Procedures that Operate on Lists</A></H3>

<P>
Scheme provides a variety of procedures for operating on lists,
so that you usually don't have to think about pairs--you can
think about whole lists.   I'll discuss these procedures in
more detail later <EM>[ put in link ]</EM>, but here's a brief
introduction. 

</P>
<P>
None of these procedures modifies its arguments--they may take lists
as arguments, but they return <EM>new</EM> lists without modifying the
old ones.
