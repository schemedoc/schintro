<P>
When you're through using Scheme interactively, you need to be able to
get out of it.  You give a command to tell the interactive Scheme system
(which is just a program) to terminate.

</P>
<P>
Most systems have a special command (starting with comma or whatever
the convention is), like <CODE>,exit</CODE>.  (It might also be <CODE>,quit</CODE>,
<CODE>,halt</CODE>, or <CODE>,bye</CODE>.)  There may be a Scheme procedure you can
evaluate to kill the system, by evaluating a procedure call expression
in the normal way, e.g., <CODE>(exit)</CODE>, <CODE>(halt)</CODE>, <CODE>(quit)</CODE>, or 
<CODE>(bye)</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
In many systems (especially under UNIX), you can use an interrupt
key sequence to kill the system, if you're at the top-level.  E.g.,
at the top-level prompt, <CODE>&#60;ctrl&#62;-D</CODE>, may do it.
