<H4><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="schintro_toc.html#SEC22"><CODE>and</CODE> and <CODE>or</CODE></A></H4>

<P>
The special forms <CODE>and</CODE> and <CODE>or</CODE> can be used as logical operators,
but they can also be used as control structures, which is why they are
special forms.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>and</CODE> takes any number of expressions, and evaluates them in
sequence, until one of them returns <CODE>#f</CODE> or all of them
have been evaluated.  At the point where one returns <CODE>#f</CODE>, <CODE>and</CODE>
returns that value as the value of the <CODE>and</CODE> expression.  If none of
them returns <CODE>#f</CODE>, it returns the value of the last subexpression.

</P>
<P>
This is really a control construct, not just a logical operator, because
whether subexpressions get evaluated depends on the reults of the previous
subexpressions.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>and</CODE> is often used to express both control flow and value returning,
like a sequence of <CODE>if</CODE> tests.  You can write something like

</P>

<PRE>
(and (try-first-thing)
     (try-second-thing)
     (try-third-thing))
</PRE>

<P>
If the three calls all return true values, <CODE>and</CODE> returns the value
of the last one.  If any of them returns <CODE>#f</CODE>, however, none of
the rest are evaluated, and <CODE>#f</CODE> is returned as the value of the
overall expression.

</P>
<P>
Likewise, <CODE>or</CODE> takes any number of arguments, and returns the value
of the first one that returns a true value (i.e., anything but <CODE>#f</CODE>).
It stops when it gets a true value, and returns it without evaluating
the remaining subexpressions.

</P>

<PRE>
(or (try-first-thing)
    (try-second-thing)
    (try-third-thing))
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>or</CODE> keeps trying subexpressions until one of them does return
a true value;  if that happens, <CODE>or</CODE> stops and returns that value.
If none of them returns anything but <CODE>#f</CODE>, it returns <CODE>#f</CODE>.

</P>

==================================================================
This is the end of Hunk A.

TIME TO TRY IT OUT

At this point, you should go read Hunk B of the next chapter
and work through the examples using a running Scheme system.
Then return here and resume this chapter.

<P>
(Go to Hunk B, which starts at section <A HREF="schintro_80.html#SEC85">An Interactive Programming Environment  (Hunk B)</A>.)
